## [Chicago Taxi Trips; 2019](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips-2019/h4cq-z3dy)

**Description:**

Taxi trips reported to the City of Chicago in its role as a regulatory agency. To protect privacy but allow for aggregate analyses, the Taxi ID is consistent for any given taxi medallion number but does not show the number, Census Tracts are suppressed in some cases, and times are rounded to the nearest 15 minutes. Due to the data reporting process, not all trips are reported but the City believes that most are.
